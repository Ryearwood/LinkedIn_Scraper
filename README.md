## LinkedIn Job Post Page Scraper
<p> Repository for Scraping LinkedIn's Job Posting Page without having to sign into an account. </p>

---

#### Need data to analyze current job post trends? 
Are you on the hunt for your next role or maybe you're casually keeping an eye out for better opportunities in new exotic places?
Why spend hours scrolling through LinkedIn when you can grab all the data with a few clicks?

That was the part of the reasoning behind my idea to build a simple, but straigthforward scraper tool - Grab some data from LinkedIn that I look at anyways and store it for use in some of my other projects.
<p> Built using Python and the Beautiful Soup Library </p>
